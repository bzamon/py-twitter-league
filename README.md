# py-twitter-league
Twitter bot made in python that tweets about my matches in League of Legends. 

To be able to use it you need a Twitter Developer account and a Riot Developer account. You can apply for both at the following links:

You can see the progress in my twitter account @mozanbot (https://twitter.com/mozanbot)
